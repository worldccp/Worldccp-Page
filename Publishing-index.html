Just because you Self-Publish doesn't mean you have to do everything on your own. When you Self-Publish through Worldccp you have full access to our Marketing and Advertising Team of Experts who give advise on what, when, and how to Market your book. Worldccp Marketing Team even helps you breakdown and define your target audience in it's purest form. So what are you waiting for!

                <div class="text3">Traditionally Publishing with Worldccp is one of our Popular Packages because all of our Authors love being able to hand over their book and watch the Royalty Checks pile up! A little cliche, but true. When you Publish with Worldccp you relieve yourself from trying to change professions, Authors are meant to be Authors, not Accountants, Advertisers, and Bookkeepers. You save yourself the hassle of researching multiple "How To" videos on Youtube not sure if the person is blindlessly leading you. So manage your time efficiently and

            <h2 class="glow"> Now Trending "Sons of Roark" Manga - Only $1.99 </h2>
         <div>
              <p class="description">  Aequitas, Veredai, Zorgan, and
                    Tokido are descendants of the Hybrid Clan.Their parents gave their lives trying to protect their
                    sons from the Hybrid Clan.
              
                  The escape pods they were sent in crash landed on Earth in 2 feuding societies. Aequitas and Veredai
                    are in the Rundown and Zorgan and Tokido are in High Society.
            

                    After landing on Earth, each pair of brothers believe the other pair of brothers are lost in outer
                    space or deceased.
              

                   Now on Earth, each pair of brothers must learn how to survive in the two feuding societies until
                    they one day meet again. This seems rather imposing considering how each society hates anyone that
                    comes from the other society. How or will the brothers reunite, and if they doâ€¦ will their
                    respective communities turn on them or will the Hybrid Clan learn of their existence and come for
                    them again?
