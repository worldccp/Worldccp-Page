           Authors' Biography
        </h2>
        <p>
           Sister to Sister, authors Hannah and Moricka Burgess have taken different paths; only to arrive at 
the same destination, with one voice, one tone, and one hunger, to write.  Each individual experience over
the last fifteen years prepared them for the unified sound of Seasons. These experiences include
publishing in the International Library of Poetry, Long Island Chronicle, freelance writing for 
Adelphi University and Howard “The Hilltop” University, ranging from ethnic and social issues to 
plays and theatrical performances.  They have written for religious institutions and enjoyed the
winnings of poetry contests.  They have presented themselves to the literary arena and today they
write as one score.

 If asked, where do I fit? I guess I’d say literary fiction with an upmarket twist of writing 
 that blends the line between commercial and fiction. I lean toward Fiction and Poetry. Anything
 created from a feeling, idea or thought compels me to read on. Where did this love come from, 
 you might ask? Nikki Giovanni's, book Love Poems showed me the powerful simplicity in writing 
 what you feel. By the stroke of her pen, she exposed herself to the world. Her legacy of the 
 love of words is what I aspire to find in other authors. Ntozake Shange's powerful drama 
 Lillian has enough literary pearls- and a few hints of crazy, to keep you engaged. 
 Some days, I’m in the mood for "laugh out loud" romantic comedies. Bridget Jones'
 Diary and Big Girl Panties are the two titles that come to mind. I believe in a world 
 with so much destructive racial and political tension driven by social media, a story we
 read that breaks through the brokenness to remind the world to laugh; calls me.
 I hope that such writing can span the decades or centuries.  Books that line the shelves 
 of tiny local bookstores where everyone knows you- a community of readers.  But, I don’t mind 
 the large chains.  They bring a sense of progress, and a reminder that no matter how busy our 
 lives get, there’s a corner nook you can hide and escape into a world of words.
 That’s why I am a part of Worldccp. And why you should be, too.  If you comb the 
 land in search of a publisher to protect and present your work in its best light for the world
 to see, then search no further.  Welcome home.  We only choose a small number of literary 
 trailblazers, so our focus isn't impeded.  We believe in working closely with our authors 
 to make sure we give their creative ambitions the biggest opportunity for success over the long term.
 There’s a story in you just like there's a story in me. 
 While sitting here looking out of my guest room window past the green fields and birch trees, 
 I see the lines of text, clearly. Do you?
 
                    Writing sample (opening) for audio:

I woke up this morning, in my South Jersey home, with a couple of sentences ringing in my ears.
“Avery was immune to good luck.  At seventeen, she was stood up for her prom, by a boy who swore
to love her for all eternity. I guess the fourth year of high school is the new eternity.
In college, she was inches away from sweeping all her courses and making the President’s list 
but during the final month of the semester, got walking pneumonia which sent her GPA plummeting…”
That’s as far as I got, this morning.  I know more will come, the next time I get to sit still 
for a while. Or when I drift off in a light haze of nothingness. 
Definitely, while I should be working on a rally, action, or “worker justice” meeting, which I 
love; the next line, or chapter will come to me.
