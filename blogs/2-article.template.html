        <p>Proverbs 10:14
The wise don't tell everything they know, but the foolish talk too much and are ruined. 

This is not to get confused with "Every form of deceit is a lie." But if you are around someone who is jealous and completely mischievous - they don't want to see you happy in your marriage, they feed you lies and negativity, every chance they get they're making some crude joke based out of hatred - those are the people you don't tell everything to. No matter who it is - your best friend, boyfriend, neighbor, mother, sister, brother and the list goes on and on... 
Test the people who are around you all the time. Tell them some amazing groundbreaking good news and look at their face. If they're not as happy as you then get away from them. They're not for you. If it looks like their face cringes while they're forcing this big smile, or they smile with a cute little "Oh" and then change the subject, or they're saying the right words but their tone and face don't match up, run for your life. What happens is that people who are not for you, use the information they get against you so that they can get the outcome that they want. This is called manipulation which is a popular form of witchcraft. 
This just goes to tell you that you need to protect yourself in order to succeed. Not everyone is going to be happy but it's important to know who those people are and keep them at bay so that you can feel better inside and look better outside. Here's what I want you to do: <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/toxic-relationships/201704/are-you-being-manipulated">Click this link</a> and arm yourself with understanding. The bible says "My people perish for a lack of understanding" Hosea 6:4. What I want you to do is understand the people around you. When you understand the tactics of people around you, you're no longer vulnerable to them. Don't hate them. Love everyone and forgive them even if they don't or won't say sorry. But don't be foolish. Be wise. Stop running your mouth.
