        <p> Oftentimes I hear people of all ages and all kinds say "I want to be like so-and-so". There's nothing wrong with being inspired but when you cloak yourself in someone else's personality, you're not you anymore. You're someone else and you're doing it wrong. I should know. I spent a long time trying to be like other people for the sake of sanity, which is kind of a contradiction because you would more than likely go insane trying to be someone else. Kind of like that movie Roommate where one college girl went incredibly hard to be like her roommate because she wanted the life the other girl lived. I just wanted the bullying and isolation - the torture - to stop. 
            But I realized that I was trying to force myself in with the "cool kids" who did nothing but follow each other, and here was this girl whose clothes were hand-sewn with fabrics from Walmart, ate roti and doubles and drank ginger beer, and smelled like Pink hair lotion and olive oil. Everyone had on Jordans and Reeboks and RocaWear. I had on handmade leather sandals straight from Trinidad. I was completely original compared to everyone else.
            If I hadn't followed the crowd, and stayed true to myself, I would have saved myself a lot of pain. But at the same time, if I hadn't put myself through so much torture, I wouldn't have such a valuable lesson to pass on to my sons: that it's best to be you and truly you. 
            Kobe was inspired by Jordan, but because Kobe stayed true to himself, he arguably became better than Jordan in many aspects. 
            At one point DC Universe tried to make movies like Marvel, and they did it horribly, until they learned to be themselves. DC came out with a movie called Shazam which was probably their best (and not so dark and dull) movie in a long time. 
            My point is, when you're writing, or drawing, or creating, or building, or whatever it is that you do, do it the way you like. Write for you because you like what you wrote. Create for you because you like what you created. Don't try to satisfy other people. You have a greater purpose to serve than someone who's made out of the same material as you! It's just best to be you.
